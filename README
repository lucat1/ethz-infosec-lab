CONTENTS

Contains solutions to the binary exploitation, side channel attack and
cryptography modules of the ISL course at ETH.

NOTICE

I have purged all files of any templating by ETH. All the solutions found here
are entirely my own.

WHY

This is mainly here to annoy people at ETH who are in charge of designing this
course, hopefully in the hope that they (are forced to) put more effort into
the teaching.
